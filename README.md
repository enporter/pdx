# PDX | 'Porter' Decentralized Exchange
This project is a fully functional decentralized exchange which operates on Ethereum (Kovan ;-) testnet actually ). Maybe one day it will be a live project on Ethereum mainnet. The token available for trading is called PTV | Porter TV token in honor of my family company [Porter TV]([http://portertv.com/](http://portertv.com/)). The tokens aren't worth anything it's all just for kicks.

What the hell does decentralized exchange mean? All trades are integrated into the Smart Contract. The trades are executed by code on the Ethereum blockchain and not code on some centralized server somewhere. This literally means you are interacting and executing trades that are completely verifiable on the blockchain. Yes you are connecting to a website that is centralized ***but*** the actual trades are being handled by the smart contract on the blockchain.

## Future Development
Looking to integrate other tokens to be able to trade multiple tokens within Ethereum.  

## How to use?
If you are not familiar with Ethereum blockchain I suggest you check out their main page [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/).

This project is currently deployed to the Kovan testnet. See  [testnet]([https://kovan-testnet.github.io/website/](https://kovan-testnet.github.io/website/)) page for more information on what is Kovan.
